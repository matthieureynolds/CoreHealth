    whatItMeans: 'Normal levels indicate good pancreatic function. Low levels might suggest Type 1 diabetes or pancreatic problems. High levels can indicate insulin resistance.',
    tips: [
      'Support pancreatic health with a balanced diet',
      'Avoid excessive sugar and refined carbohydrates',
      'Include chromium and magnesium-rich foods',
      'Exercise regularly to support insulin function',

    category: 'Blood Sugar',
    explanation: 'HOMA-IR calculates how resistant your cells are to insulin. It\'s like measuring how hard your body has to work to keep blood sugar normal.',
    whatItMeans: 'Lower values indicate better insulin sensitivity. Values above 2.0 suggest insulin resistance, which increases risk of diabetes and metabolic syndrome.',
    tips: [
      'Follow a low-carbohydrate or Mediterranean diet',
      'Exercise regularly, especially strength training',
      'Lose weight if overweight',

    explanation: 'Urea (BUN) is a waste product from protein breakdown that your kidneys filter out. It\'s like checking how well your kidneys are cleaning protein waste from your blood.',
    whatItMeans: 'Normal levels indicate good kidney function. High levels might suggest kidney problems, dehydration, or high protein intake. Low levels are usually not concerning.',
    tips: [
      'Stay well hydrated throughout the day',

    explanation: 'Cystatin C is a more accurate measure of kidney function than creatinine, especially in older adults or those with muscle loss. It\'s like a better ruler for measuring kidney health.',
    whatItMeans: 'Normal levels indicate good kidney filtration. High levels suggest declining kidney function and may detect kidney problems earlier than creatinine.',

    explanation: 'This measures protein leakage in your urine, which can be an early sign of kidney damage. It\'s like checking for leaks in your kidney\'s filtering system.',
    whatItMeans: 'Normal levels mean your kidneys aren\'t leaking protein. Higher levels suggest kidney damage, often from diabetes or high blood pressure.',
    tips: [
